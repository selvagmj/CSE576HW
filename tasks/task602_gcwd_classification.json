    "Definition": "This task is about reading the given passage and finding whether the passage strongly or weakly agrees with the target opinion which is whether Global warming is caused by human activities. Answer only with keyword (a) strongly - if passage strongly agrees with target (b) weakly - if passage weakly agrees with target. A passage strongly agrees with target when the probability of agreement is than 0.7.",
